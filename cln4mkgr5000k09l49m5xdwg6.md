Hi! This is my first post on Hashnode, so I'll be brief.

I am a software engineer (or "developer") who lives in Toronto, Canada. I have many years of experience in software development, most of it in C++, mixed with other languages, such as Python, C#, JavaScript and some Java. But in the last few years, my interest is shifting to better languages, Rust for system programming and Erlang/Elixir for the development of distributed, scalable, fault-tolerant systems.
